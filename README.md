# Welcome to Insta Scrape

Insta Scrape is a simple script adopted from code written by [tikseniia](https://github.com/tikseniia/get-location-instagram/blob/master/script.py) in order to scrape location data from Instagram without the need for an API key.

Insta Scrape currently sits in Jupyter Notebook for ease of debugging and sharing with team members.
